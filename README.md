Maps from Minecraft servers for free download

600 Maps

This is a service, aiming to provide access to maps of various Minecraft servers (deleted and active). It is also meant as an archive for deleted server maps, that might still hold some emotional and nostalgic value to some players. You might use the maps how you want, be it privately or publicly.
**HOWEVER**: All the maps still belong to their original creators. So if you intend to use them for your own server or in some other public way, it is advised to ask for their permission first. Each map contains a file, called "Credits.txt", that stores the credits of the map (mostly Minecraft in-game names) if they are known. If not, you could ask staff members of the server the map originated from or search for heads or signs of the builders on the map.

If you have maps that are still missing here or have questions, corrections or requests, you can contact me by adding "moongirlseline" on Discord.
